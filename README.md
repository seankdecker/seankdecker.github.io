# Dev Notes

- Git authentication happens through HTTPS
  - to `https://seankdecker@github.com/seankdecker/seankdecker.github.io`
  - b/c I use 2FA, I needed to create a Personal Access Token on github
  - it is stored using `git config credential.helper store`, since
  my global config is using `user: seanktakahashi`
