This page plays a random video from a selection of =
versions of 上を向いて歩こう　by 坂本　九 (in English,
Sukiyaki by Ryu Sakamoto)

Not only do I enjoy the song's melody, but I think
it's history is quite fascinating.

The song was crated in 1961, in a still realing
post-war Japan. It was taken to America, and
called Sukiyaki because Ue wo muite arukou was a
little wordy and supposidly hard to remember for
American audiences.

It made the Billboard top 100, an uncommon feat for
an East Asian song (as of late actually, Kpop has
been changing this). The song was covered by Selena
and it was played as mood music on the Gemini 7.

Kyu Sakamoto died in the crash of Japan Airlines 123,
the most deadly single aircraft accident in history
as of this writing.
